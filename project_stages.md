## Becoming an OpenSSF Project

The OpenSSF's mission is to inspire and enable the community to secure the open source software we all depend on. OpenSSF is focused on the security of existing open source project however, there are missing pieces in the tooling needed to improve project security. These pieces are the projects OpenSSF aims to steward and support. 

# Project Life Cycle

New projects to the OpenSSF, and progression through the project lifecycle, are approved by the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). Projects oversight is provided by either the TAC (if project is independent from a WG) or a WG (if project is part of a specific WG and follows that WG's governance). 

Projects follow the Sandbox, Incubating, Graduated and Archival lifecycle stages defined below. Projects that seek widespread adoption and end user use are expected to progress through the stages.

A project's lifecycle stage is a signal of maturity level. Projects progress through the lifecycle by demonstrating their maturity in technical vision, impact to the open source community, and sustainability in governance and contributors. All projects, at all stages, are expected to abide by the OpenSSF's Code of Conduct. 


### Sandbox

The OpenSSF Sandbox is the entry point for early stage projects and has four goals:

* Encourage experimentation and open collaboration that can add value to the OpenSSF mission and build the ingredients of a successful Incubation level Project
* Facilitate alignment with existing Working Groups or Projects if this is desired
* Nurture Projects
* Remove possible legal and governance obstacles to adoption and contribution by ensuring all projects adhere to OpenSSF legal, code of conduct, and IP Policy requirements.

#### Project Responsibilities

* Bi-annual updates to the TAC on technical vision and progress on vision
* Maintain a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project)
* Provides project updates to OpenSSF Marketing Committee as requested

#### Project Support
* Receives guidance on technical direction from TAC
* Receives space for Contributor Summits at OpenSSF bi-annual events
* Receives OpenSSF Code of Conduct Committee support
* Reserved space for project updates in OpenSSF newsletters
* May request infrastructure support from the OpenSSF
* Projects, sponsors, and contributors may not promote the project with the OpenSSF logo or be referred to as an "OpenSSF Project" or "OpenSSF $ProjectName." Projects may say they are, "A sandbox project in the OpenSSF" or "An experimental project in the OpenSSF." 

#### Sandbox Entry Requirements and Considerations

* Projects must have a minimum of two maintainers with different company affiliations.
* Projects must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.

### Incubating

![Incubating]

Incubating projects represent maturing but not fully realized projects. Incubating projects have an established technical vision and working project, but are still refining implementation, discovering (and adapting to) new use cases, and operating as an open source team. 

#### Project Responsibilities

* Bi-annual updates to the TAC on technical vision and progress on vision
* Maintain a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project) with an active flow of contributions
* Follow security best practices (as recommended by the OpenSSF and others)
* Maintain a point of contact for vulnerability reports
* Implement, practice, and refine mature software development and release practices such a following a version schema

#### Project Support
* Receives guidance on technical direction from TAC
* Receive a TAC or WG sponsor for guidance as an Incubation project
* Receives space for Contributor Summits at OpenSSF bi-annual events
* Receives OpenSSF Code of Conduct Committee support
* Receives infrastructure support (details determined by project leads and OpenSSF Budget Committee)
* Receives support with vulnerability disclosure from the OpenSSF (Vulnerability Disclosure WG)
* May post project updates and tutorials to the OpenSSF blog
* May request OpenSSF budget for project improvements such as security audits or time-bound contracting needs
* With additional TAC or WG approval, may fundraise for dedicated project funds, coordinated by the OpenSSF
* Projects may use the OpenSSF logo to promote their project (in accordance with the trademark guidelines). Projects may not be referred to as an "OpenSSF Project" or "OpenSSF $ProjectName." Projects may say they are an "OpenSSF Incubating Project."  

#### Incubating Entry Requirements and Considerations

* Projects must have a minimum of three maintainers with a minimum of two different company affiliations.
* Projects must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and be a novel approach for existing areas, address an unfulfilled need, or be initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.
* Projects should be able to show adoption by multiple parties and that adoption's value to the open source community and or end users (may include adoption of beta/early versions).
* Projects must have documented, initial project governance.

#### Project Process: Sandbox to Incubating

Incubating Projects are required to undergo technical due diligence as a part of the process to move from Sandbox to Incubation. Technical Due Diligence is driven by a TAC or parent WG sponsor. Once the diligence is complete and the proposal made, two weeks are allocated for public comment before a TAC vote is called.

### Graduated

Graduated projects signal the highest level of maturity for an OpenSSF project. Graduated projects have consistent, mature open source development practices with sustained contribution and activity. 

#### Project Responsibilities

* Bi-annual updates to the TAC on technical vision and progress on vision
* Maintain a diversified contributor base (i.e. not a single-vendor project) with an active flow of contributions
* Follow security best practices (as recommended by the OpenSSF and others)
* Maintain a point of contact for vulnerability reports and follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
* Implement, practice, and refine mature software development and release practices such a following a version schema

#### Project Support
* Receives guidance on technical direction from TAC 
* Receives space for Contributor Summits at OpenSSF bi-annual events
* Receives OpenSSF Code of Conduct Committee support
* Receives infrastructure support (details determined by project leads and OpenSSF Budget Committee)
* Receives support with vulnerability disclosure from the OpenSSF (Vulnerability Disclosure WG)
* May post project updates and tutorials to the OpenSSF blog
* May request OpenSSF budget for project improvements such as security audits or time-bound contracting needs
* May request OpenSSF for sustained maintainer stipends (details determined by OpenSSF and project leads)
* With additional TAC or WG approval, may fundraise for dedicated project funds, coordinated by the OpenSSF
* Projects may use the OpenSSF logo to promote their project (in accordance with the trademark guidelines). Projects may be referred to as an "OpenSSF Project" or "OpenSSF $ProjectName." 

#### Graduated Project Entry Requirements and Considerations

* Projects must have a minimum of three maintainers with a minimum of two different company affiliations.
* Projects must be aligned with the OpenSSF mission and be a novel approach for existing areas or address an unfulfilled need. Projects with duplicate, similar or competing fuctionality to an existing OpenSSF project may be denied Graduation status if the TAC does not see technical justification for overlapping projects. 
* Projects must be able to show adoption by multiple parties and that adoption's value to the open source community and or end users.
* Projects must be able to show a consistent release cadence.
* Projects must have documented project governance and be able to demonstrate that governance in action.
* When applicable, projects must have completed a security audit through a third party and addressed audit findings and recommendations

#### Project Graduation Process: Incubating to Graduation

Graduation requires undergoing due diligence as a part of the process to move from Incubation to Graduation. Due Diligence is driven by a TAC or parent WG sponsor. Once the diligence is complete and the proposal made, two weeks are allocated for public comment before a TAC vote is called.

### Archiving

Open source projects have a lifecycle and there are times that projects become inactive due to a variety of reasons. There are also cases where a project may no longer want to be supported by the OpenSSF, or the OpenSSF TAC may no longer wish to recommend the use of a project. Archiving happens through a vote of the TAC, and can be requested by the corresponding project's lead(s) or a TAC member. 

#### Archiving Criteria

When voting on a proposal to archive a project, TAC members may consider:
* If the project has consistently met the Project Requirements
* If the project still supports the OpenSSF mission
* If the project's inactivity or inconsistent maintenance presents a user security risk
* If the project design or approach is no longer a recommended best practice


#### Submission Forms to Archive

1. [Proposal](TBD)
2. [Legal](TBD)

### Archived

Archived projects are no longer in active development and are only archived after a TAC or parent WG vote.

What does archiving for an OpenSSF project mean?
* OpenSSF will no longer provide budgetary, event, or marketing support for the project
* Project maintainers may request trademark transfers from the OpenSSF and Linux Foundation
* OpenSSF can provide services such as documentation updates to help transition users.
* Other OpenSSF activities will no longer be provided for the project

To archive a project:
* A proposal must be put forth to the TAC or WG repo
* The TAC or parent WG will inform the project maintainers, OpenSSF end user community and wider community of all archiving proposals
* The proposal must remain open for at least 2 weeks of discussion after the maintainers are informed.
* A vote must be finalized with 2/3 approval from the TAC or parent WG.
